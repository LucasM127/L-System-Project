Interpreter binary subdivides the planar bounds either (+) horizontally or (-) vertically.
Interesting effect when use this subset of productions below and colour each id a unique colour.
The subdivision 'rectangles' are all square, but as only two colours or ids are showing at a time, looks like something would get from turtle graphic interpretation.
