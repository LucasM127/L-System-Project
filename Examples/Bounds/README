Interpreter binary subdivides the planar bounds either (+) horizontally or (-) vertically into 2 equally sized rectangles.  [ pushes a rectangle as new outer bounds.  A counter is used to keep track of which subdivided rectangle to further subdivide.
Interesting effect when use this subset of productions below and colour each id a unique colour.
The subdivision 'rectangles' are all square, but as only two colours or ids are showing at a time, looks like something would get from turtle graphic interpretation.
